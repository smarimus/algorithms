 2.	Merge trees

Merge two BSTs in O(N1 + N2) time, where N1 and N2 are number of nodes in the two trees respectively. 
The merged tree should contain all the elements of both trees and also be a balanced BST. Finally, print the new tree level by level. 
 
e.g.
Tree-1:  2->1,3
Tree-2:  7->6,8
Output:
 
6
2 7
1 3 8
 
The output above is a tree that's printed level by level.
 
(This is a very good question. It's not hard at all, but will need you to write several functions: one to parse, one to sort, one to merge, 
one to reconstruct and one to print. Each of these can be separate short interview questions)
